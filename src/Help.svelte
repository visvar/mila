    <HelpTextDrawer heading="What is this website?">
        <p class="explanation">
            This website contains a collection of small apps for learning
            musical instruments. They are each tailored to specific musical
            skills and sometimes also specific kind of musical data or
            instrument.

    <HelpTextDrawer heading="What do I need to use the apps?">
        <p class="explanation">
            Many app require a MIDI instrument, such as a keyboard or electronic
            drum kit. Other MIDI instruments will work too, just try it! A few
            apps work with audio and should therefore supported any (pitched)
            instrument and singing. Some apps can also be used with a PC
            keyboard (spacebar if not explained otherwise) or a touch screen.
            The most tricky to use are the guitar (fretboard) apps, which
            require are MIDI guitar or a guitar with an added MIDI pickup.

            <b>App Menu (‚ò∞).</b>
            The app menu lists all apps with a short description and icons that indicate
            the supported instruments. You can filter and sort apps by different
            aspects with the sidebar on the left. Apps that you never used before
            are marked with a ‚ú®.

            <b>Tools (üõ†Ô∏è).</b>
            The tools page contains smaller, but sometimes helpful tools. For example,
            you can see which MIDI messages your instrument sends.

        <p class="explanation">
            <b>Settings (‚öôÔ∏è).</b>
            Global settings that apply to multiple (but not all) apps. Here you can
            export and delete all locally stored data.

        <p class="explanation">
            <b>Data and Saving.</b>
            You can export and import a take in most apps. Whenever you leave an
            app, reset, or load from the history, your current take will be auto-saved
            and added to the history. Use the history button too see the modal with
            the auto-saved takes where you can load or delete them.

                >No data is sent anywhere, it all is saved in your browser. You
                can export or reset it in the settings (‚öôÔ∏è).</i
