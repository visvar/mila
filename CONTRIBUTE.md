# Contributing

The best way to contribute is using the apps and creating issues for problems and ideas.
You can also implement a new app, since they are separated well there should be no side-effects.

## Adding a new app

- add the .svelte file in [/src/apps/](/src/apps/)
- add the app description and import in [/src/apps.js](/src/apps.js)
